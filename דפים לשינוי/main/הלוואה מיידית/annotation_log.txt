This is a task list for editing an HTML file. The file contains annotations for 2 fixes needed:

1. **Section styling fix**: Adapt the styling to match the existing page style by:
   - Using only existing CSS classes (with prefix like wpc-*)
   - Not inventing new colors - only use colors already in the page
   - Removing unnecessary inline styles and replacing with existing classes

2. **Remove link**: Remove the `<a>` tag from the "הלוואה ללא ריבית" text, keeping only the text

Would you like me to:
1. Execute these fixes on the HTML file?
2. Just review what needs to be done?
3. Something else?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
